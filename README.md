# Android_offline_ExternalDB_Dictionary
I have used DB Browser for SQLite for the offline dictionary.The dataset is only of 10 words but it can be increased by updating 
the datbase any time.Due to time limitation and request of some one dataset is set to be limited.But soon it will be updated above 1000
words.
I have also used Text to speech conversion and Speech to text conversion in the dictionary.
